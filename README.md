# Hello!
My name is sandro and today i'll help you to make sense of my project!

## Technologies Used:

- React (using create-react-app)
- Axios
- Reflex-Grid React library (that you hinted at in the brief)

## Installation
- Clone this Repo
- move to the folder using a terminal and run "npm install"
- after the installation is finished, just run "npm start" and a local development server will start with my app.
