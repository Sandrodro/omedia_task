# Github Api App


# Hello!
My name is sandro and today i'll help you to make sense of my project!

## Technologies Used:

- React (using create-react-app)
- Axios
- Reflex-Grid React library (that you hinted at in the brief)

## IMPORTANT

The Github API requires a user token to authenticate with the api. I can not embed my own token in the 
source files because of security reasons and also Github will rewoke any access key it finds in the files.
So, in order to run my app you should insert your own token in OMEDIA_TASK/.env directory.
There will be a variable called REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN and your token should be its value, a placeholder value is already provided there.

(The Token value is then used in OMEDIA_TASK/src/services/github_api.js file)

## Installation
- Clone this Repo
- move to the folder using a terminal and run "npm install"
- after the installation is finished, just run "npm start" and a local development server will start with my app.
